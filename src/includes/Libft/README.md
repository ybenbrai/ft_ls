# Introduction

Programming in C is a very laborious activity since you do not have access to
all these usual little practical functions. This is why we offer you
through this project to take the time to rewrite these functions, to understand them and
to appropriate them for you. You can then reuse your library to work
effectively on your following C projects.
This project is also an opportunity for you to expand the list of requested functions
with yours and make your library even more useful. Feel free to
complete your libft throughout your schooling once this project is no longer
just a memory for you.
